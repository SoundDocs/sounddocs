## üöÄ Development

This guide provides instructions for setting up the SoundDocs project for local development.

### Quick Start

For experienced developers, here are the essential commands to get the project running:

1.  **Clone and Checkout `beta` Branch**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SoundDocs/sounddocs.git
    cd sounddocs
    git checkout beta
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Start Local Supabase Services**:
    ```bash
    supabase start
    ```
4.  **Set Up Web App Environment**:
    Copy the local Supabase credentials output by the previous command into a new `.env` file in `apps/web`.
5.  **Generate SSL Certificate**:
    ```bash
    cd agents/capture-agent-py
    python3 generate_cert.py
    cd ../..
    ```
6.  **Start the Web App**:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
7.  **(Optional) Run Capture Agent**:
    If developing agent-related features:
    ```bash
    cd agents/capture-agent-py
    ./run.sh # or run.bat
    ```

### Detailed Setup Guide

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js**: v18+ (LTS recommended).
- **pnpm**: This project uses `pnpm` for package management. If you don't have it, install it globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```
- **Docker**: The Supabase CLI uses Docker to run the local development environment. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Supabase CLI**: Required for managing the local Supabase stack. Follow the official installation guide for your OS: [Supabase CLI Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).
- **Python**: v3.11+ is required for the capture agent.
- **mkcert**: A tool for creating trusted local SSL certificates. The capture agent's `run` script will attempt to install this for you if you have Homebrew (macOS) or Chocolatey (Windows) installed.

#### 1. Web App Setup

First, set up the main web application.

1.  **Clone the Repository and Checkout `beta`**:
    All development should be done on the `beta` branch.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SoundDocs/sounddocs.git
    cd sounddocs
    git checkout beta
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Start Local Supabase Services**:
    This command uses Docker to start all the necessary backend services (database, auth, etc.).
    ```bash
    supabase start
    ```
4.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    After `supabase start` completes, it will output your local credentials (API URL and anon key). Create a new file at `apps/web/.env` and add the credentials to it:
    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-local-anon-key-from-the-cli
    ```
5.  **Generate SSL Certificate**:
    The Vite development server requires a trusted SSL certificate to run over HTTPS.

    ```bash
    cd agents/capture-agent-py
    python3 generate_cert.py
    cd ../..
    ```

    The script uses `mkcert` and may prompt for your password to install a local Certificate Authority (CA). This is a crucial one-time step.

6.  **Start the Development Server**:
    Now you can start the web app.
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `https://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

#### 2. (Optional) Capture Agent Development

If you are working on features related to the "AcoustIQ Pro" audio analyzer, you will need to run the Python-based capture agent locally. The HTTPS dev server is a prerequisite for the secure WebSocket (`wss://`) connection the agent uses.

1.  **Navigate to the Agent Directory**:
    In a **new terminal window** (leaving the web app server running), go to the agent's directory:
    ```bash
    cd agents/capture-agent-py
    ```
2.  **Run the Agent**:
    The `run` script handles installing dependencies and starting the agent.

    - **macOS/Linux**: `./run.sh`
    - **Windows**: `run.bat`

    The agent will now be running and can communicate with the web app.

_This section has been moved and integrated into the main setup guide._

## üåê Self-Hosting

To self-host SoundDocs, you will need a remote Supabase project.

1.  **Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies**:
    Follow steps 1 and 2 from the "Web App Setup" section.
2.  **Create a Supabase Project**:
    Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    Create a file at `apps/web/.env` and add your remote Supabase project's credentials:
    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url (looks like https://(projecturl).supabase.co)
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
    ```
    You can find these in your Supabase project's API settings.
4.  **Apply Database Migrations**:
    In your Supabase project dashboard, go to the "SQL Editor" and run the contents of the migration files located in the `/supabase/migrations` directory in chronological order.
5.  **Build and Deploy**:
    Build the application and deploy the contents of the `apps/web/dist` folder to your preferred hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3).
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
