## üöÄ Development

This guide provides instructions for setting up the SoundDocs project for local development.

### Quick Start

For experienced developers, here are the essential commands to get the project running:

1.  **Clone and Checkout `beta` Branch**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SoundDocs/sounddocs.git
    cd sounddocs
    git checkout beta
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Start Local Supabase Services**:
    ```bash
    supabase start
    ```
4.  **Set Up Web App Environment**:
    Copy the local Supabase credentials output by the previous command into a new `.env` file in `apps/web`.
5.  **Generate SSL Certificate**:
    ```bash
    cd agents/capture-agent-py
    python3 generate_cert.py
    cd ../..
    ```
6.  **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
7.  **Start the Web App**:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
8.  **(Optional) Run Capture Agent for Development**:
    If developing agent-related features, run from source:

    ```bash
    cd agents/capture-agent-py
    python -m capture_agent  # or python main.py
    ```

    **For end users**: Download the professional installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SoundDocs/sounddocs/releases) instead.

### Detailed Setup Guide

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js**: v18+ (LTS recommended).
- **pnpm**: This project uses `pnpm` for package management. If you don't have it, install it globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```
- **Docker**: The Supabase CLI uses Docker to run the local development environment. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Supabase CLI**: Required for managing the local Supabase stack. Follow the official installation guide for your OS: [Supabase CLI Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).
- **Python**: v3.11+ is required for capture agent development.
- **mkcert**: A tool for creating trusted local SSL certificates.
  - **For end users**: The [professional installers](https://github.com/SoundDocs/sounddocs/releases) handle mkcert setup automatically
  - **For developers**: Manual installation required:
    - **macOS**: `brew install mkcert`
    - **Windows**: `choco install mkcert`
    - **Linux**: Follow the [mkcert installation guide](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation).
      After installing, run `mkcert -install` to create a local Certificate Authority.

#### 1. Web App Setup

First, set up the main web application.

1.  **Clone the Repository and Checkout `beta`**:
    All development should be done on the `beta` branch.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SoundDocs/sounddocs.git
    cd sounddocs
    git checkout beta
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Start Local Supabase Services**:
    This command uses Docker to start all the necessary backend services (database, auth, etc.).
    ```bash
    supabase start
    ```
4.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    After `supabase start` completes, it will output your local credentials (API URL and anon key). Create a new file at `apps/web/.env` and add the credentials to it:
    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-local-anon-key-from-the-cli
    ```
5.  **Generate SSL Certificate**:
    The Vite development server requires a trusted SSL certificate to run over HTTPS.

    ```bash
    cd agents/capture-agent-py
    python3 generate_cert.py
    cd ../..
    ```

    This script uses `mkcert` to generate the necessary certificate files.

6.  **Build the Project**:
    Build the project before starting development.
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
7.  **Start the Development Server**:
    Now you can start the web app.
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `https://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

#### 2. (Optional) Capture Agent Development

If you are developing features related to the "AcoustIQ Pro" audio analyzer, you can run the Python-based capture agent from source. The HTTPS dev server is a prerequisite for the secure WebSocket (`wss://`) connection the agent uses.

**Note**: End users should download the [professional installers](https://github.com/SoundDocs/sounddocs/releases) instead of following these development instructions.

1.  **Navigate to the Agent Directory**:
    In a **new terminal window** (leaving the web app server running), go to the agent's directory:
    ```bash
    cd agents/capture-agent-py
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
3.  **Run the Agent**:
    Start the agent in development mode:

    ```bash
    python -m capture_agent
    # or alternatively:
    python main.py
    ```

    The agent will now be running and can communicate with the web app at `wss://localhost:9469`.

#### 2b. Building the Capture Agent from Source

These instructions are for developers who want to compile the capture agent from local source code. This process uses your local files and does **not** download any code from GitHub.

##### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+

##### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the agent's directory and install all required dependencies, including the `pyinstaller` packaging tool.

```bash
cd agents/capture-agent-py
pip install -e . "cryptography>=41,<44" pyinstaller
```

##### 2. Build the Executable

Run the `pyinstaller` command to build the standalone executable.

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --name sounddocs-capture-agent --add-data "capture_agent:capture_agent" --add-data "generate_cert.py:." main.py
```

The compiled application will be located in the `dist` directory.

## üåê Self-Hosting

To self-host SoundDocs, you will need a remote Supabase project.

1.  **Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies**:
    Follow steps 1 and 2 from the "Web App Setup" section.
2.  **Create a Supabase Project**:
    Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    Create a file at `apps/web/.env` and add your remote Supabase project's credentials:
    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url (looks like https://(projecturl).supabase.co)
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
    ```
    You can find these in your Supabase project's API settings.
4.  **Apply Database Migrations**:
    In your Supabase project dashboard, go to the "SQL Editor" and run the contents of the migration files located in the `/supabase/migrations` directory in chronological order.
5.  **Build and Deploy**:
    Build the application and deploy the contents of the `apps/web/dist` folder to your preferred hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3).
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
