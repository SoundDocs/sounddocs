## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use one of the following private channels:

1.  **GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting:** The preferred method is to use the "Report a vulnerability" feature on the "Security" tab of our GitHub repository. This ensures the report is private and gets to the right people quickly.
2.  **Email:** If you prefer, you can send an email to `security@sounddocs.org`.

Please include the following information in your report:

- A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any relevant code snippets, screenshots, or videos.
- The potential impact of the vulnerability.
- Any suggested mitigation or remediation actions.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security vulnerability report, we will do our best to:

- Acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
- Provide an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability.
- Keep you informed of our progress.
- Notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed.

We will not publicly disclose the vulnerability until a fix has been released and we have coordinated with you on the disclosure.
